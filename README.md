# Movie-Recommender-System
## Overview
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a given movie based on various attributes like the movie's overview, keywords, cast, and crew.

## Features
### Content-Based Filtering: 
The system uses detailed movie information to generate recommendations. Each movie is represented by a combination of its overview, keywords, cast, and crew, providing a comprehensive profile that captures various aspects of the movie.
### Similarity Calculation:
The recommendation system calculates the similarity between movies using advanced techniques. By comparing the combined features of movies, it identifies those that share significant similarities with the target movie, ensuring relevant and accurate recommendations.
### Data Preprocessing:
The project includes robust data preprocessing steps to clean and transform raw text data into a machine-readable format. This involves handling missing values, tokenizing text, and creating a unified feature set that enhances the accuracy of the recommendations.
### Ease of Use: 
The project includes clear and straightforward scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and generating recommendations. Users can quickly set up and use the system with minimal configuration.
## Usage
### Prepare the Data: Ensure you have a dataset containing movies with attributes such as overview, keywords, cast, and crew.

Preprocess the Data: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Build the Model: Train the recommendation model using the processed data.

Get Recommendations: Use the trained model to get movie recommendations.

Example
Here is an example of how to use the recommendation system in a Python script:

Import the recommendation function.
Get 12 similar movies to a given movie ID.
Print the recommended movies.
Files
preprocess.py: Script to preprocess the movie data.
train_model.py: Script to train the recommendation model.
recommend.py: Script to get movie recommendations.
recommender.py: Contains the core recommendation logic.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy

Returning 12 Similar Movies
To implement the recommendation logic and return 12 similar movies:

Load the dataset and ensure it includes columns for overview, keywords, cast, and crew.
Fill any NaN values and combine relevant features into a single string.
Convert the text data to feature vectors using a vectorizer.
Compute the cosine similarity matrix.
Create a function to get movie recommendations based on the cosine similarity scores.
Make sure to replace the dataset path with the actual path to your dataset. This code assumes the dataset includes the necessary columns and that each row corresponds to a unique movie.
